     - backend  
        - Java(Spring...) / Python(Django/flask/fastapi) / Nodejs(nestjs) / Go(gin/beego/...)  the web framework

laws and limitations  
- Web3 jobs often lack Chinese labor contracts, social insurance, and pay in tokensâ€”risking unpaid wages, frozen funds, and legal trouble. Vet projects, demand compliant pay, and avoid shady crypto cash-outs.  

cybersecurity  
- risks and attack methods
    -  phishing 
        - forge official websites, social accounts, emails and text messages, induce victims to click on malicious links and enter sensitive information (such as mnemonics, private keys and account passwords) , or download malicious software.
    - malware & trojan
        - masquerading as interview/learning software  
        - clipboard hijacking
        - backdoor browser extension/plug-in 
        - remote control
   - social engineering
        - impersonate HR/mentor/classmate
        - catfish 
        - stolen accounts
    - supply chain/third party dependency attacks
    - clipper/scanning bots
    - traditional privacy and account security risks
- how to avoid: official Channel + dual authentication + cold storage private key + address verification  
my own experience  
- MySQL server deployed in cloud server, due to simple password, was hacked and they asked for some btc
