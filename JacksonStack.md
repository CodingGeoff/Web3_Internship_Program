> How to Be a Reliable Web3 Intern (Bruce’s Perspective)  
> Exactly what I need
  
1. Definition of Reliable  
   Predictable (deliver when promised) + Communicative (speak up early when blocked) + Reflective (post-mortem & improve).

2. Time Estimation – “Experience Multiplier”  
   Multiply your gut estimate by 1.25–2× depending on familiarity; break tasks into micro-steps; add 10–15 % buffer; pre-align with mentor.

3. Classic Unreliable Behaviors  
   Ghosting, perpetual “it’ll be done tomorrow,” and silent solo grinding until deadline.

4. Communication Cadence  
   First weeks: daily 3-line update (what I did / stuck on / plan). After that, ping the team within 30 min of being stuck, but always try self-troubleshooting first.

5. Balancing Depth vs Delivery  
   Write a 30-min mini-plan or flowchart, then iterate in layers: core feature → polish. Never sacrifice the hard deadline.

6. Key Soft Skills & How to Test  
   - Clear communication – watch structured storytelling.  
   - Deep thinking – ask successive “why” questions.    this reminds me the classic blog " How To Ask Questions The Right Way"
   - Reflection – give small challenges and see if they self-review and adapt.

7. Coaching When Slipping  
   Ask intern to describe problem & attempted fixes; set a one-week improvement window. Repeated identical mistakes = attitude issue; varied mistakes that are quickly fixed = skill gap.

8. Final Advice  
   Web3 rewards openness; reliability multiplies learning speed.

*if you don't know what to learn to gain a job, take a look at the jb(job description) to know the requirements*  

-    so basically, just the old school way with some extra things related to the chain  
     - frontend  the basic h5/c3/js or ts and a framework vue or react(nextjs in particularly) and something to the chain (ether.js/web3.js old time, viem now)  
     - backend  
        - Java(Spring...) / Python(Django/flask/fastapi) / Nodejs(nestjs) / Go(gin/beego/...)  the web framework   
        -  db tech and how to interact with them: mysql/ pgsql/ redis/ mongodb/....
        - api    restful graphql rpc
        - message queue    rabbitmq/rocketmq/kafka
        - cloud    docker/kubernets
        - ci/cd  gitlab
    - smart contract   
        - nft   erc standards...
        - go to hackquest to know more, like solidity for eth, rust for arb and sol, Move for sui  ...
- for other jobs    it does not mean these jobs don't need any tech skills, many of them require the ability of data analysis, wtf...   excel, r/julia/python/sql/bi.. even spark...

laws and limitations  
- Web3 jobs often lack Chinese labor contracts, social insurance, and pay in tokens—risking unpaid wages, frozen funds, and legal trouble. Vet projects, demand compliant pay, and avoid shady crypto cash-outs.  

cybersecurity  
- risks and attack methods
    -  phishing 
        - forge official websites, social accounts, emails and text messages, induce victims to click on malicious links and enter sensitive information (such as mnemonics, private keys and account passwords) , or download malicious software.
    - malware & trojan
        - masquerading as interview/learning software  
        - clipboard hijacking
        - backdoor browser extension/plug-in 
        - remote control
   - social engineering
        - impersonate HR/mentor/classmate
        - catfish 
        - stolen accounts
    - supply chain/third party dependency attacks
    - clipper/scanning bots
    - traditional privacy and account security risks
- how to avoid: official Channel + dual authentication + cold storage private key + address verification  
my own experience  
- MySQL server deployed in cloud server, due to simple password, was hacked and they asked for some btc
