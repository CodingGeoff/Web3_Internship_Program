# 2025-08-05

1. 实战项目：链上留言板
合约功能：用户通过地址提交留言，数据永久存储，事件触发日志。
开发步骤：
Remix IDE编写/编译合约。
部署到本地VM或Sepolia测试网（需领取测试ETH）。
通过Etherscan验证合约与事件日志。
2. 前端与合约交互
技术栈：HTML+JavaScript+Web3.js（或现代工具Viem/Wagmi）。
关键步骤：
连接钱包（MetaMask授权）。
合约实例化（ABI+地址）。
写操作：用.send()发起交易（需Gas）。
读操作：用.call()查询数据（免费）。

1. Blockchain Fundamentals:
Definition: Blockchain is defined as a decentralized, distributed ledger technology.
Key Features: Its core attributes are being immutable, transparent, anonymous, and fast.
Functionality: It operates through distributed bookkeeping. The notes also mention different types of chains (Public, Private, Consortium) and distinguish between Web 2.0, Web 3.0 (semantic web), and "Web3" where the blockchain stores assets and smart contracts automatically execute rules, enabling Dapps.
Visual Representation: A diagram illustrates a decentralized network of nodes (mining machines) connected to each other, forming a blockchain.
2. Ethereum as "Blockchain 2.0":
Definition: Ethereum is introduced as a more advanced, community-driven technology, evolving blockchain into a globally shared, distributed computer.
Core Novelty: Its key innovation is the smart contract, which enables it to function as an infrastructure for Dapps, DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.
Evolution: It is undergoing a significant evolution from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) via the Beacon Chain to improve efficiency.
3. Ethereum's Ecosystem and Architecture:
Layered Structure: The ecosystem is broken down into Layer 1 (the mainnet with the EVM and account system) and Layer 2 solutions (Rollups and Sidechains) for scaling. It is also structured into an Application Layer, Protocol Layer, and Scaling Layer.
Core Mechanisms: The notes detail its key working mechanisms:
Account System: Distinguishes between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) controlled by private keys and Contract Accounts (CAs) controlled by smart contracts.
Gas: The fee required to execute transactions.
EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine): The runtime environment for smart contracts.
Transaction Process: A simple process flow is outlined: users initiate transactions via an EOA, which the EVM executes, modifying storage, and then Gas fees are deducted.
4. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Comparison Table:
A detailed table systematically compares the two cryptocurrencies across five key dimensions:
Goal & Positioning: Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, while Ethereum is a decentralized platform for Dapps.
Programming Capability: Bitcoin has limited scripting, whereas Ethereum is Turing-complete, allowing for complex smart contracts.
Consensus Mechanism: Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW), while Ethereum is transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS).
Transaction Speed: Bitcoin is slow (10 min/block), while Ethereum is much faster (~12 sec/block).
Economic Model: Bitcoin has a fixed, deflationary supply, whereas Ethereum's supply is flexible but can become deflationary through mechanisms like EIP-1559.
